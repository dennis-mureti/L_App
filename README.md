LiMA platform is an e-commerce solution developed by mHealth Kenya in partnership with ICIPE to make eco-friendly products for controlling livestock diseases available to farmers. These products, which include a tsetse repellent and a fungus-derived pesticide, have been developed by ICIPE to address the issues of tsetse flies and ticks, two major vectors of livestock diseases. Through the platform, farmers will have access to these innovative products, allowing them to protect their livestock in a sustainable and effective manner.
